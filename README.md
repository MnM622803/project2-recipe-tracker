📌 Description

Recipe Tracker is a web application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete their favorite recipes. Each recipe includes a title, description, ingredients, instructions, and an optional image. It’s a simple, user-friendly tool for organizing and managing personal or shared cooking ideas.

This app was built as a personal project to practice full-stack development skills using the MEN (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) stack along with EJS for templating. The idea was inspired by the need to keep family recipes in one accessible place.
